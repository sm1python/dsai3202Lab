# Questions?!?!?!


Q) Description of code:

Q) parts to be distributed and parallelized? and why?
    1) Fitness evaluation is the sequential part so it should be parallelized O(n),
    2) Population Regeneration because its O(n^2)



Q) What Algorithm enhancement?
    1) 

Q) How would u add cars to the problem?
